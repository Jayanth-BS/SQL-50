-- Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

-- Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

-- The result format is in the following example.

 

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Seat table:
-- +----+---------+
-- | id | student |
-- +----+---------+
-- | 1  | Abbot   |
-- | 2  | Doris   |
-- | 3  | Emerson |
-- | 4  | Green   |
-- | 5  | Jeames  |
-- +----+---------+
-- Output: 
-- +----+---------+
-- | id | student |
-- +----+---------+
-- | 1  | Doris   |
-- | 2  | Abbot   |
-- | 3  | Green   |
-- | 4  | Emerson |
-- | 5  | Jeames  |
-- +----+---------+

-- Solution:

SELECT IF(id<(SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat),IF(id%2=0,id-1,id+1),IF(id%2=0,id-1,id)) AS id,student 
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id
